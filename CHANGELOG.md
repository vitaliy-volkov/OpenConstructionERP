## [1.4.8] — 2026-04-11

### Real-time collaboration L1 — soft locks + presence (issue #51)

Maher00746 asked: "Does the platform support real-time collaboration
when multiple users are working on the same BOQ?". The full collab
plan has 3 layers: L1 (soft locks + presence), L2 (Yjs Y.Text on text
fields), L3 (full CRDT BOQ rows). This release ships **L1**, which
covers the maher00746 90% case ("two estimators editing the same
position should not trample each other") without dragging in a CRDT
runtime, Yjs, or Redis. L2 / L3 remain on the v1.5 / v2.0 roadmap.

#### New module ``backend/app/modules/collaboration_locks/``
Self-contained module with manifest, models, schemas, repository,
service, router, presence hub, sweeper, and event bridge — 1,580
backend LOC across 10 files. Mounted at ``/api/v1/collaboration_locks``.
Named ``collaboration_locks`` (not ``collaboration``) so it does not
collide with the existing comments / viewpoints module.

- ``oe_collab_lock`` table (Alembic migration ``a1b2c3d4e5f6``) with
  ``UniqueConstraint(entity_type, entity_id)`` so only one user can
  hold a row at a time. Indexed on ``expires_at`` and ``user_id``.
- **Atomic acquire** via read-then-insert-or-steal at the repository
  level — cross-dialect (SQLite dev + PG prod), races handled by
  catching ``IntegrityError`` and re-reading the winner. Expired
  rows are stolen *in place* via UPDATE so the unique constraint
  never trips.
- **Heartbeat extends TTL** in 30s steps; rejected if the caller is
  not the holder.
- **Release** is idempotent and only honoured for the holder.
- **Background sweeper** runs every 30s, purges rows where
  ``expires_at < now()``. Uses its own session per iteration so a
  sweeper failure cannot roll back any in-flight request.
- **Entity-type allowlist** mirrors the existing ``collaboration``
  module — clients cannot lock arbitrary strings. Returns 400 on
  rejection.
- **409 conflict body** is a distinct ``CollabLockConflict`` schema
  with ``current_holder_user_id``, ``current_holder_name``,
  ``locked_at``, ``expires_at``, ``remaining_seconds`` so the
  frontend can render a useful toast without a follow-up GET.
- **Naive datetime normalisation** via ``_as_aware()`` helpers in
  repository + service — SQLite's ``DateTime(timezone=True)``
  returns naive Python datetimes, so every comparison gets coerced
  to UTC first. Same pattern already used in ``dependencies.py``
  for ``password_changed_at``.

#### Presence WebSocket
``WS /collaboration_locks/presence/?entity_type=...&entity_id=...&token=<jwt>``
broadcasts JSON frames to every connected client subscribed to the
same entity. Auth via the ``token`` query param because browser
WebSocket cannot set headers — same pattern as the BIM geometry
endpoint. The ``PresenceHub`` is worker-local in v1.4.8 (single
``presence_hub = PresenceHub()`` module-level instance, no Redis,
no Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY) — multi-worker deployments still get
correct *locking* via the DB but presence broadcasts are
worker-scoped. Documented in the module docstring; the upgrade
path to LISTEN/NOTIFY is a single internal swap with no caller
changes.

Wire format (every frame is JSON ``{event, ts, ...}``):

| event | extras | when |
|---|---|---|
| ``presence_snapshot`` | ``users[]``, ``lock`` | first frame after upgrade |
| ``presence_join`` | ``user_id``, ``user_name`` | another user opened the entity |
| ``presence_leave`` | ``user_id`` | user closed all their tabs on the entity |
| ``lock_acquired`` | ``lock_id``, ``user_id``, ``user_name``, ``expires_at`` | any user claimed the lock |
| ``lock_heartbeat`` | ``lock_id``, ``user_id``, ``user_name``, ``expires_at`` | holder renewed TTL |
| ``lock_released`` | ``lock_id``, ``user_id``, ``user_name`` | holder voluntarily released |
| ``lock_expired`` | ``lock_id``, ``user_id`` | sweeper removed a stale lock |
| ``pong`` | — | response to client ``"ping"`` keepalive |

The ``presence_join`` broadcast uses ``exclude=websocket`` so the
joiner does not receive their own join event. ``lock_acquired``
intentionally does NOT exclude — the holder *should* see the echo
so the UI can confirm the state transition from the event stream
(useful for multi-tab consistency).

Multi-tab same user: the hub deduplicates by ``user_id`` in the
roster. ``leave()`` walks remaining sockets to check whether the
departing user still has another tab on this entity before
broadcasting ``presence_leave``. The lock itself is idempotent per
user (re-acquire refreshes TTL).

#### Frontend hook + indicator + BOQ wiring
``frontend/src/features/collab_locks/`` — 5 files, 636 LOC:
- ``api.ts`` — typed clients with a tagged-union return type so
  TypeScript narrows ``CollabLock`` vs ``CollabLockConflict``
- ``useEntityLock.ts`` — auto-acquire on mount, 15s heartbeat,
  cleanup-release on unmount. Catches every error and degrades
  gracefully — a network drop transitions to ``'released'`` and
  re-acquires on the next focus event. Worst case: user types
  for ~15s without a live lock (race window between expiry and
  next sweep at 60s TTL + 30s sweep interval).
- ``usePresenceWebSocket.ts`` — JWT-via-query-param connection,
  roster state, event stream
- ``PresenceIndicator.tsx`` — green / amber / blue pill badge
  ("You are editing" / "Locked by Anna 3:42 remaining" / "N viewers")
- ``index.ts`` — barrel re-exports

**BOQ wiring** in ``frontend/src/features/boq/BOQGrid.tsx``:
- Acquires on ``onCellEditingStarted`` (per ROW, not per cell —
  tracks held locks in a ``rowLockMapRef`` and re-uses on
  subsequent cell edits within the same row)
- Releases on new ``onCellEditingStopped`` callback
- Releases all held row locks on unmount
- 409 cancels the edit and shows a toast with the holder name +
  remaining seconds. Network errors degrade silently — the user
  can still edit, just without collab safety.

9 new i18n keys (``collab_locks.lock_held_by_you``,
``collab_locks.lock_held_by_other``, ``collab_locks.lock_conflict_toast``,
``collab_locks.viewers_label`` etc.) all via ``t(key, { defaultValue })``
so the UI works today without a translation pass.

#### Tests — 17 / 17 passing

``backend/tests/integration/test_collab_locks.py`` — 14 tests
covering: acquire when free / conflict, idempotent re-acquire,
heartbeat extends / rejects non-holder, release, idempotent
release of missing-id, allowlist 400, ``GET /entity/`` returns
none-or-holder, ``GET /my/`` lists my locks, expired-lock-can-be-
stolen via direct DB forge, sweeper removes expired rows.

``backend/tests/integration/test_collab_locks_ws.py`` — 3
WebSocket tests: rejects missing token (1008), delivers
``presence_snapshot`` + ``lock_acquired`` to subscribers, delivers
``presence_join`` across two clients.

#### What is deliberately NOT in v1.4.8

- **L2 — Yjs Y.Text on description / notes** → v1.5. Requires
  ``yjs`` + ``y-websocket`` deps + server-side CRDT state
  persistence. Not needed for the maher00746 case.
- **L3 — full CRDT BOQ rows** → v2.0. 3x the surface of L1 with
  marginal UX gain over soft locks for our user base.
- **Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY fan-out** → only needed for multi-
  worker deployments wanting cross-worker presence. The hub
  interface stays stable; only ``_broadcast`` needs a second
  implementation gated on settings.
- **Audit log of lock events** → the event bus already publishes
  ``collab.lock.*``; an audit subscriber can be added in a
  follow-up without touching this module.
- **Org-scoped RBAC** → ``org_id`` column exists but is unused.
  Matches the current behaviour of the ``collaboration`` module.
- **Frontend wiring for non-BOQ entities** → only BOQ row editing
  is wired in this PR. Requirements / RFIs / tasks / BIM elements
  are already in the allowlist; the hook + indicator are ready
  to drop into any of those editors.

### Verification
- Backend ``ruff check`` clean across the new module + tests
- 17/17 collab_locks integration tests passing in 65.7s
- ``check_version_sync.py`` passes at 1.4.8
- Frontend ``tsc --noEmit`` exit 0
- Alembic migration chains correctly on top of head ``b2f4e1a3c907``

## [1.4.7] — 2026-04-11

### Added — UX polish + cross-module event hooks

#### BIM viewer geometry-loading progress bar
The BIM viewer used to show only a generic spinner while the COLLADA
geometry blob downloaded — a 100MB Revit model could take 30+ seconds
with no visible progress, so users assumed the page had hung.
``ElementManager.loadDAEGeometry`` now accepts an ``onProgress``
callback that surfaces the XHR ``loaded / total`` ratio, and
``BIMViewer`` renders a determinate progress bar with percentage
indicator, gradient fill, and "Streaming geometry from server…" /
"Finalising scene…" status text.

#### Sidebar BETA badges (subtle, modern)
``/bim``, ``/bim/rules``, and ``/chat`` are still under heavy
development.  Added a tiny lowercase ``beta`` badge to each of those
nav items so users know not to rely on those modules for production
work yet.  The badge style is intentionally understated — neutral
grey, 9px, lowercase — so it does not visually compete with the
sidebar's normal items.

#### Restored rich GitHub README
``README.md`` was rewritten to a 53-line minimal version in d3d2319
that dropped the Table of Contents menu, the comparison table, the
feature gallery, and the workflow diagram.  This release restores
the rich 450-line version (badges, ToC table, why-OpenConstructionERP
table, vendor comparison, complete-estimation-workflow diagram, 12
feature blocks with screenshots, regional standards table, tech
stack, architecture diagram) — bumped to v1.4.6 in the version
badge and footer.

### Fixed

#### Frontend correctness
- **F1**: ``BIMPage.tsx:602`` dropped two ``(res as any)`` casts on
  the upload response.  ``BIMCadUploadResponse`` now declares
  ``element_count: number`` and a typed ``status`` union, so the
  upload toast no longer guesses fields that may not exist.
- **F5**: ``BIMFilterPanel`` now resets every transient filter slot
  (search, storey checkboxes, type checkboxes, expanded headers,
  active group highlight) when the user switches to a different
  BIM model.  Previously the checkbox UI carried over Storey 5
  selections from the old model into the new one — confusing UX
  where the displayed filter did not match the applied predicate.

#### Cross-module wiring
- **T2.3**: ``Assembly.total_rate`` is no longer stale when a
  ``CostItem.rate`` changes externally.  New ``assemblies/events.py``
  subscribes to ``costs.item.updated``, finds every ``Component``
  pointing at the updated cost item, refreshes the per-component
  ``unit_cost`` + ``total``, and re-runs the parent assembly total
  math (sum of components × ``bid_factor``).  BOQ positions
  generated from an assembly BEFORE the rate change are intentionally
  NOT touched — they're locked financial commitments at create time;
  the next regenerate of the position picks up the new rate.
- **T3.5**: ``requirements.list_by_bim_element`` now uses the
  PostgreSQL JSONB ``@>`` containment operator at the SQL level when
  the dialect is PG, so the database does the filtering instead of
  loading every project requirement and filtering in Python.
  SQLite still uses the Python fallback (no portable JSONB
  operator).  Mirrors the dialect-aware pattern in
  ``tasks/service.py::get_tasks_for_bim_element``.

#### Test infrastructure
- **T8 (deferred from v1.4.5)**: 12 broken integration tests that
  failed since v1.3.x with 404 / 422 / 403 errors are now passing.
  Root cause was a mix of:
  - Trailing-slash mismatch (10 tests): tests called
    ``/boqs/{id}/positions`` without the slash but the route is
    ``/boqs/{id}/positions/``.  ``redirect_slashes=False`` is
    intentional in main.py to kill CORS 307 redirect issues with
    the frontend, so the FIX is to add the slash to the test
    paths.  Audited every parametric POST in
    ``test_cross_module_flows.py`` + ``test_api_smoke.py``.
  - Missing required query param (1 test):
    ``test_tendering_packages`` was hitting ``/tendering/packages/``
    without the mandatory ``project_id`` (security: prevents
    cross-tenant enumeration).  Fixed to create a throwaway project
    first.
  - Permission scope (1 test):
    ``test_cost_regions`` and ``test_vector_status`` had no
    auth header — the endpoints require ``contacts.read`` or
    similar.  Fixed to pass ``auth_headers``.

### Notifications subscriber dialect guard
The S3 subscriber framework added in v1.4.6 (boq.created /
meeting.action_items_created / cde.state_transitioned event hooks)
opened its own short-lived session via ``async_session_factory()``
to call ``NotificationService.create()``.  Under SQLite this
deadlocked against the upstream service's still-open transaction
because SQLite is single-writer per file.  The handlers now probe
the dialect at entry and bail out fast on SQLite — production uses
PostgreSQL where this is a non-issue, and the dev SQLite path
simply skips the in-app notification (the upstream mutation still
succeeds).  A v1.5 background-task refactor will move notification
create out of the upstream transaction altogether.

### Project Intelligence smart actions implementation (T2.1)
The three "smart action" tiles on ``/project-intelligence`` were
stub redirects that opened the validation / cost-catalog / scheduler
pages and let the user finish the action manually.  ``actions.py``
now actually performs the work:
- ``run_validation`` loads the project's oldest BOQ, runs
  ``ValidationModuleService.run_validation`` with
  ``rule_sets=["din276","boq_quality"]``, and returns the new
  ``ValidationReport`` id plus pass / warning / error counts.
- ``match_cwicr_prices`` walks every leaf BOQ position with a
  zero ``unit_rate``, calls ``CostItemService.suggest_for_bim_element``
  with the position description and classification, and writes the
  top match's rate back to ``unit_rate`` (with ``total = qty × rate``
  recomputed and the matched code/score saved into ``metadata_``).
  Publishes ``boq.prices.matched`` so vector re-indexing subscribers
  can react.
- ``generate_schedule`` refuses if a schedule already exists,
  otherwise creates a draft ``Schedule`` keyed off
  ``project.planned_start_date`` and delegates to
  ``ScheduleService.generate_from_boq``, returning ``schedule_id``
  + ``activity_count``.

Every action wraps its body in try/except so failures surface as
``ActionResult(success=False, message=...)`` rather than 500.
9 new unit tests cover happy path + no-BOQ guards + service-raises
branches.

### Vector routes factory (T9)
6 of 8 module routers were carrying ~50 lines each of copy-pasted
``vector/status`` + ``vector/reindex`` boilerplate (documents,
tasks, risk, validation, requirements, erp_chat).  Extracted the
common shape into ``app/core/vector_routes.py:create_vector_routes()``
which takes a model + project_id_attr (or a custom loader for
parent-scoped modules), the read/write permissions, and a vector
adapter.  Each module router now does ``include_router(create_vector_routes(...))``
in 4 lines instead of 50.  Net result: **-105 LOC** in module
routers, ~291 lines of duplicated boilerplate eliminated, all 16
existing vector routes preserved exactly.  ``boq`` and ``bim_hub``
keep their hand-written endpoints because they accept extra
optional query params (``boq_id`` / ``model_id``) that the
factory does not yet model.

### Costmodel honest schedule reporting + delete-snapshot
The 5D cost-model dashboard previously reported every project as
"on_track / at_risk" even when no schedule data was available,
because ``calculate_evm`` had a hard-coded ``time_elapsed_pct =
50.0`` fallback.  This skewed portfolio rollups and made unscheduled
projects look like they were silently 50 % done.

- The fallback is gone.  ``schedule_known: bool`` is set only when
  date parsing actually succeeds; otherwise ``evm_status`` is
  ``schedule_unknown`` and the dashboard renders "no schedule yet"
  instead of a fake percentage.
- Bonus fix in ``full_evm/service.py``: TCPI was crashing on
  ``Decimal(0)`` denominators.  Three-branch decision now yields
  ``"inf"`` sentinel when remaining work exists but the budget is
  exhausted, and ``Decimal(0)`` when both are zero.
- New ``DELETE /api/v1/costmodel/projects/{pid}/5d/snapshots/{sid}``
  endpoint (gated by ``costmodel.write``) for cleaning out stale
  snapshots without dropping into a SQL shell.  Emits
  ``costmodel.snapshot.deleted`` event.

21 new unit tests, total suite 963 passing, zero regressions.

### BIM frontend correctness wave (F2/F3/F4/F6)
- **F4** — ``AddToBOQModal`` derived ``effectiveBOQId`` via
  ``useMemo`` from ``(boqs, userSelectedBOQId)`` so a BOQ getting
  removed mid-flow can not leave the modal pointing at a stale id.
  Tightened the React Query ``enabled`` guard with
  ``!boqsQuery.isLoading`` for first-render correctness.
- **F2** — All four BIM link modals
  (``AddToBOQModal``/``LinkDocumentToBIMModal``/``LinkActivityToBIMModal``/``LinkRequirementToBIMModal``)
  reset their internal state when the parent's ``elements`` array
  identity changes, so reopening the modal after switching elements
  always starts clean.
- **F3** — ``LinkActivityToBIMModal`` and
  ``LinkRequirementToBIMModal`` replaced the hardcoded "showing
  first 200, +N more…" stub with proper pagination
  (``PAGE_SIZE = 50`` + "Load more (N remaining)" button), with
  the page cursor resetting on both element change and search
  text change.
- **F6** — ``ElementManager`` now tracks every cloned ``THREE.Material``
  it creates in ``colorByDirect``/``colorBy`` via a
  ``createdMaterials`` set and disposes them in ``resetColors`` and
  ``dispose``, plugging a slow GPU memory leak that grew every
  time the user toggled status colouring.

### Levels filter — rename "Storeys" → "Levels", real Level support
The BIM filter panel labelled the storey filter "Storeys" but
Revit users overwhelmingly think in terms of "Level" (the actual
Revit property name).  Worse, when the upload row had no top-level
``storey`` column the filter would silently miss elements whose
level was buried inside the ``properties`` JSONB blob — common
for Revit Excel exports where "Level" lives as a Type Parameter,
not a column.

- Backend ``_rows_to_elements`` (``bim_hub/router.py``) now calls
  a new ``_extract_storey(row, props)`` helper that first checks
  the top-level column (already aliased from ``level``,
  ``base_constraint``, ``host_level_name``, etc. via
  ``_BIM_COLUMN_ALIASES``), then falls back to a 20-key
  case-insensitive scan of the ``properties`` blob: ``Level``,
  ``Base Level``, ``Reference Level``, ``Schedule Level``,
  ``Host Level``, ``IFCBuildingStorey``, ``Geschoss``, ``Etage``…
- ``_normalise_storey()`` coerces literal ``"None"`` / ``"<None>"``
  / ``"null"`` / ``"-"`` / ``"—"`` strings to None so they don't
  pollute the filter panel with a fake "None (586)" bucket.  This
  was visible in screenshots from real Revit exports.
- Frontend ``BIMFilterPanel.tsx`` rename: "Storeys" → "Levels",
  "by Storey" → "by Level", "No storeys detected" → "No levels
  detected", search placeholder updated.  i18n keys renamed to
  ``bim.filter_levels``, ``bim.filter_no_levels``,
  ``bim.filter_group_level`` with English defaults.  Internal
  state keys (``state.storeys``, ``el.storey``, API param
  ``storey=``) are unchanged so saved filter groups and the
  ``BIMQuantityRulesPage`` form continue to work.

### BIM converter preflight + one-click auto-install
Uploading a ``.rvt`` file at ``/bim`` previously consumed 18 MB of
upload, saved it to disk, then silently failed with "Could not
extract elements from this CAD file" when ``find_converter('rvt')``
returned None and ``process_ifc_file`` returned an empty result.
Two issues stacked: no preflight, and the frontend hardcoded a
generic English error string instead of using the backend's
``model.error_message``.  All the converter-install plumbing
already existed (``GET /api/v1/takeoff/converters/`` +
``POST /api/v1/takeoff/converters/{id}/install/``) but the BIM
upload page never used it.

**Backend preflight (``bim_hub/router.py``)** — new
``_NEEDS_CONVERTER_EXTS = {".rvt", ".dwg", ".dgn"}``.  At the very
top of ``upload_cad_file``, before ``await file.read()``, we call
``find_converter(ext.lstrip("."))`` and refuse the upload up-front
with ``status="converter_required"`` (200 OK, not error) when the
binary is missing.  The response includes ``converter_id`` and
``install_endpoint`` so the frontend can route the user straight
into the install flow without wasting an upload roundtrip.  The
success-path response was extended with ``error_message``,
``converter_id``, and ``install_endpoint`` fields so the frontend
can render the actual reason instead of guessing.

**Real DDC repo (``takeoff/router.py``)** — the converter
auto-installer was pointing at a non-existent
``ddc-community-toolkit`` releases URL.  Rewritten to walk the
real ``datadrivenconstruction/cad2data-Revit-IFC-DWG-DGN``
repository via the GitHub Contents API, recursively listing
``DDC_WINDOWS_Converters/DDC_CONVERTER_{FORMAT}/`` and downloading
each file from ``raw.githubusercontent.com``.  Verified live
against the upstream repo: 175 files / 598 MB for RVT, 143 / 241
MB IFC, 252 / 218 MB DWG, 252 / 217 MB DGN.

- Files install into per-format directories
  (``~/.openestimator/converters/{ext}_windows/``) so each
  converter's bundled Qt6 DLLs and Teigha format readers do not
  collide with other formats.
- Downloads run in parallel via a ``ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=8)``
  — RVT goes from ~5 minutes sequential to ~30-60 seconds without
  tripping GitHub abuse detection.
- Path traversal defence runs BEFORE any network IO so a
  hostile listing fails fast instead of partway through 600 MB of
  downloads.
- Atomic rollback on partial failure (``shutil.rmtree`` of the
  per-format dir) so a half-installed converter can not confuse
  ``find_converter`` on the next call.
- Linux returns ``platform_unsupported: true`` with the apt commands
  needed to install ``ddc-rvtconverter`` etc. via the upstream
  apt source ``pkg.datadrivenconstruction.io``.  We deliberately
  do NOT auto-shell-out to ``sudo apt`` from a web handler.
- macOS / other platforms get a graceful "convert to IFC first"
  message — the IFC text parser works on every platform.

``find_converter`` (``boq/cad_import.py``) extended to probe both
the new per-format Windows install dirs and the Linux apt install
paths (``/usr/bin/ddc-{ext}converter``,
``/usr/local/bin/ddc-{ext}converter``) so installed converters
are picked up instantly with no service restart.

**Frontend banner + install prompt (``BIMConverterStatusBanner.tsx``,
``InstallConverterPrompt.tsx``, +233 LOC in ``BIMPage.tsx``)** —
new amber banner above the BIM page lists every converter that
needs installation with name, real size in MB, and a one-click
Install button.  Installs run via React Query mutation with
spinner, success toast, and automatic banner refetch on completion.

When the user drops a ``.rvt`` / ``.dwg`` / ``.dgn`` file and the
converter is missing, a pre-upload guard intercepts the drop and
opens ``InstallConverterPrompt`` instead of starting the upload —
no megabytes wasted.  The prompt shows the converter name, real
size from the GitHub-derived metadata, and an "Install &
auto-retry upload" button that on success replays the original
upload with the saved file bytes.  The previously hardcoded
"Could not extract elements" error string is replaced with the
backend's actual ``error_message``.  27 new i18n keys (all with
English ``defaultValue``) so the UI works today without a
translation pass.

Backwards compatible: older backends that do not return
``converter_id`` fall through to the legacy ``needs_converter``
toast.

### Verification
- Backend ``ruff check`` clean across every v1.4.7-touched file
- 16/16 tests in the BIM converter preflight + cross-module + PI
  action suites passing in 34.5s
- 963 unit tests passing in the costmodel/finance/full_evm suite
- ``check_version_sync.py`` passes at 1.4.7
- ``integrity_check.py`` passes (23 hits)
- Frontend ``tsc --noEmit`` exit 0, zero errors
- Live test of GitHub Contents API directory walk against the real
  ``cad2data-Revit-IFC-DWG-DGN`` repo confirms ``RvtExporter.exe``
  is reachable and 175 files enumerate cleanly

## [1.4.6] — 2026-04-11

### Security — IDOR fixes (driven by wave-2 deep audit)

#### S1 — Contacts module: query scoping
Three TODO(v1.4-tenancy) markers in ``contacts/router.py`` flagged
that ``Contact`` had no ``tenant_id`` and any authenticated user with
``contacts.read`` could read **every** contact in the database.  The
get/patch/delete endpoints already had a ``_require_contact_access``
gate, but the list/search/by-company/stats endpoints were unscoped.
Fixed by threading an ``owner_id`` parameter through repository →
service → router that filters on the ``created_by`` proxy column.
Admins still bypass and see the global view.

- ``contacts/repository.py`` — ``list()``, ``stats()``, ``list_by_company()``
  all accept an optional ``owner_id`` filter
- ``contacts/service.py`` — same
- ``contacts/router.py`` — list/search/stats/by-company endpoints now
  resolve the caller's role via ``_is_admin()`` and pass either
  ``user_id`` (non-admin) or ``None`` (admin) as the owner filter

#### S2 — Collaboration module: permissions + entity allowlist
``collaboration/router.py`` had **zero** permission checks.  No
``RequirePermission`` decorator on any endpoint, no entity access
validation.  Any authenticated user could list / create / edit /
delete comments and viewpoints across project boundaries.  Fixed by:

- New ``collaboration/permissions.py`` — registers
  ``collaboration.read`` (Viewer), ``collaboration.create`` /
  ``.update`` / ``.delete`` (Editor)
- New ``collaboration/__init__.py`` ``on_startup`` hook that wires
  the registration
- ``collaboration/router.py`` rewritten to add ``RequirePermission``
  to all 7 endpoints
- New ``_ALLOWED_ENTITY_TYPES`` allowlist (16 entries: project, boq,
  document, task, requirement, bim_element, etc.) — any other value
  is rejected at the router boundary so we never persist orphaned
  metadata.  Fixes the prior bug where ``entity_type='unicorn'``
  was silently accepted.

### Cross-module wiring

#### S3 — Notifications subscriber framework
The notifications module had ``create()`` and ``notify_users()`` since
day one but **nothing in the platform actually called them** —
contacts / collaboration / cde / transmittals / teams all silent on
mutations.  Created ``notifications/events.py`` with a declarative
``_SUBSCRIPTIONS`` map and an ``on_startup`` hook that wires the
event bus on module load.  Initial subscriptions:

- ``boq.boq.created`` → notify the creator (info)
- ``meeting.action_items_created`` → notify each task owner
  (task_assigned) for the items that ACTUALLY produced a Task row
- ``cde.container.state_transitioned`` → notify the actor (info)
- ``bim_hub.element.deleted`` → audit echo skeleton (no-op until
  the upstream payload includes a user-id target)

Adding a new event trigger is now a one-line entry in
``_SUBSCRIPTIONS`` — keeps the cross-module event topology auditable
from a single grep.

#### C5 — Raw SQL → ORM in 3 remaining cross-link sites
v1.4.4 fixed the bim_hub upload cross-link.  The same fragile
hand-rolled ``INSERT INTO oe_documents_document`` via ``text()``
pattern still existed in three other places — replaced each with a
clean ``Document(...)`` ORM insert that picks up timestamps + defaults
from the Base mixin and stays in sync with any future schema
migration:

- ``punchlist/router.py:288`` (punch photos)
- ``meetings/router.py:967`` (meeting transcripts)
- ``takeoff/router.py:1855`` (takeoff PDFs)

All four cross-link sites now use the ORM.  Verified with
``grep -c "INSERT INTO oe_documents_document"`` returning 0 across
all four files.

#### C6 — Meetings: stop publishing event when task creation fails
``meetings/service.py::complete_meeting`` wrapped task creation from
action items in a try/except that swallowed all errors with
"best-effort" logging — and then published
``meeting.action_items_created`` regardless.  Downstream subscribers
(notifications, vector indexer) were told the work was done even
when zero tasks made it into the DB.  Fixed by:

- Per-action-item isolation: a single failed item no longer aborts
  the others
- Track ``created_action_items`` and ``failed_action_items``
  separately, surface both via the response
- Only publish the event when at least one task actually persisted;
  payload now carries ``created_count`` / ``failed_count`` so
  notification subscribers can show "3 of 5 tasks created"

### Project Intelligence

#### T1.1 — Collector wires 4 missing modules
``project_intelligence/collector.py`` collected state from 9 domains
(BOQ, schedule, takeoff, validation, risk, tendering, documents,
reports, costmodel) but was **completely blind** to requirements,
bim_hub, tasks, and assemblies.  ``ProjectState`` had no fields for
them.  Score lied — a project with perfect BOQ but zero requirements
got a falsely high score.  Fixed by:

- New ``RequirementsState`` / ``BIMState`` / ``TasksState`` /
  ``AssembliesState`` dataclasses
- New ``_collect_requirements`` / ``_collect_bim`` / ``_collect_tasks``
  / ``_collect_assemblies`` parallel collectors
- Each new collector uses cross-dialect SQL (works on SQLite +
  PostgreSQL) and falls back to default state on exception with a
  WARNING-level log instead of the previous DEBUG-level swallow
- ``collect_project_state`` now ``asyncio.gather``s 14 collectors
  instead of 10
- ``ProjectState`` exposes 4 new fields so the scorer / advisor /
  dashboard can surface gaps like "no requirements defined" or
  "BIM elements not linked to BOQ"

Smoke-tested against the live database — collectors return real
counts for the 5 most recent projects (which include data created
by the v1.4.5 cross-module integration tests).

### Verification
- Backend ``ruff check`` clean across every file touched in v1.4.6
- 174 unit + integration tests passing (vector adapters x7 +
  property matcher + requirements↔BIM cross-flow + BIM processor)
- ``scripts/check_version_sync.py`` passes at 1.4.6
- ``scripts/integrity_check.py`` passes (10 hits)

### Deferred to v1.4.7 / v1.5.0
- ``project_intelligence/actions.py`` 3 of 8 actions still dead code
  (run_validation / match_cwicr_prices / generate_schedule fall back
  to redirect lying about execution)
- ``costmodel`` vs ``full_evm`` redundancy — both compute EVM with
  different logic, frontend uses neither, needs strategic decision
- ``costmodel`` PV approximation flaw (BAC × time_elapsed%)
- BIM frontend correctness: 14 findings in BIMPage.tsx + 5 link
  modals (200-item caps, modal pattern inconsistency, race
  conditions, type-unsafe casts)
- Assembly ``total_rate`` invalidation on CostItem.rate change
- ``create_vector_routes()`` factory + reduce ~250 LOC duplication
- Trailing-slash audit of 12 broken integration tests
- Test coverage push: 0 tests for costmodel/finance/full_evm and 6
  of 8 shared infra modules

## [1.4.5] — 2026-04-11

### Fixed — deep-audit cut driven by 3 parallel sub-agents

Three multi-agent deep audits of the recently-added v1.4.x modules
(requirements, project_intelligence, erp_chat, vector_index, bim_hub
element groups, quantity maps, assemblies) flagged 40+ findings.
This cut tackles the cross-module-correctness ones — fixes that
make existing features actually do what they advertise — plus the
biggest test-coverage holes.

#### Cross-module data integrity
- **Orphaned BIM element ids cleaned up on element delete**.  Three
  of five cross-module link types denormalise BIM ids into JSON
  arrays (Task.bim_element_ids, Activity.bim_element_ids,
  Requirement.metadata_["bim_element_ids"]) instead of FK tables.
  The FK-based ones (BOQElementLink, DocumentBIMLink) cleaned
  themselves up via ``ondelete='CASCADE'``; the JSON ones leaked
  stale references **forever**, confusing the BIM viewer's
  "linked tasks/activities/requirements" panel and every reverse
  query helper.  New ``bim_hub.service._strip_orphaned_bim_links``
  runs INLINE on the active session inside ``bulk_import_elements``
  and ``delete_model``, so the cleanup shares the upstream
  transaction (no SQLite write-lock contention) and rolls back
  atomically on failure.  Integration test
  ``test_orphan_bim_ids_stripped_on_element_delete`` pins the
  behaviour end-to-end.
- **Requirement embeddings now include pinned BIM element ids**.
  After ``link_to_bim_elements`` fired the linked_bim event the
  vector indexer re-embedded the row, but
  ``RequirementVectorAdapter.to_text()`` never read
  ``metadata_["bim_element_ids"]`` so the embedding was unchanged
  and semantic search like *"requirements linked to roof elements"*
  returned zero.  ``to_text()`` now appends a sample of up to 5
  pinned ids; the full list still lives in metadata.  5 new unit
  tests cover present/empty/missing/non-dict metadata edge cases.

#### Hacks → real implementations
- **Property filter ``_matches`` is now type-aware**.  The dynamic
  element-group predicate used exact equality
  ``props.get(key) == value`` and the quantity-map rule engine
  used ``str(value).lower()``.  Both silently failed on multi-valued
  IFC properties (e.g. ``materials = ["steel", "concrete"]``
  vs filter ``materials = "steel"`` returned False because list !=
  string).  New shared helper
  ``BIMHubService._property_value_matches`` handles strings via
  fnmatch, lists via membership/intersection, dicts via recursive
  containment, and ``None`` via explicit "must not be set"
  semantics.  20 unit tests pin every branch.
- **Quantity map applies surface skipped (element, rule) pairs**.
  ``_extract_quantity`` returned ``None`` when the source property
  was missing and the loop just ``continue``'d, so estimators saw
  unexpectedly-empty BOQ populations with no clue why.  Skips are
  now collected with a structured ``reason`` (``missing_property``
  or ``invalid_decimal``), surfaced via two new fields on
  ``QuantityMapApplyResult`` (``skipped_count`` + ``skipped[]``),
  and the service logs a warning with the first skip when any are
  detected.

#### Concurrency
- **Per-collection ``asyncio.Lock`` on ``reindex_collection``**.
  Two concurrent reindex requests against the same vector
  collection (e.g. startup auto-backfill racing an admin-triggered
  ``POST /vector/reindex/``) could interleave purge + index ops
  and leave the store in an inconsistent state with partial
  indexes, duplicate ids, and ghost rows.  Now serialised by a
  module-level ``dict[str, asyncio.Lock]`` lazily populated via
  ``_get_reindex_lock``.  Reindexes against DIFFERENT collections
  still run in parallel — the locks are per-name.

#### Missing CRUD
- **``PATCH /requirements/{set_id}``** — lets users rename a set,
  edit its description, change source type, or update workflow
  status without delete-and-recreate (which lost history and any
  BIM/BOQ links the set's requirements owned).  Project re-assignment
  is intentionally NOT supported — sets are project-scoped at
  creation.
- **``POST /requirements/{set_id}/requirements/bulk-delete/``** —
  delete up to 500 requirements in a single transaction.  Ids
  belonging to a different set are silently skipped; the response
  carries ``deleted_count`` and ``skipped_count`` so the UI can
  surface "deleted N of M" mismatches.  Each successful delete
  fires the standard ``requirements.requirement.deleted`` event.

#### Type discipline
- **``GateResult.score`` migrated from ``String(10)`` to ``Float``**.
  The column stored a stringified percentage like ``"85.5"`` but
  the Pydantic schema and router both treated it as a float —
  every write went through ``str(score)`` and every read through
  ``float(score_raw)``.  Worse, ``ORDER BY score DESC`` returned
  ``"9.5"`` above ``"85.0"`` because string comparison happens
  character by character (any "top N gate runs" report was
  silently wrong).  New Alembic migration ``b2f4e1a3c907`` runs an
  idempotent batch-alter that coerces unparseable rows to ``0``
  before the type change.  Service writes a real ``float`` now;
  the router still calls ``float()`` defensively for backward
  compat with un-migrated databases.

#### Test coverage push
- **Unit tests for 7 of 8 vector adapters** (BOQ, Documents, Tasks,
  Risks, BIM elements, Validation, Chat).  Previously only the
  Requirements adapter (added in v1.4.3) had unit coverage; the
  other 7 were untested. **113 new test cases** following the
  canonical template — collection_name singleton, to_text full row
  + empty + None tolerant, to_payload title build + UUID stringify
  + clipping + fallback, project_id_of resolves + None fallback.
- **`backend/tests/unit/test_bim_property_matcher.py`** — 20 tests
  pinning every branch of the new type-aware property matcher.
- **`backend/tests/integration/test_requirements_bim_cross.py`** —
  3rd test ``test_orphan_bim_ids_stripped_on_element_delete``
  drives the full orphan-cleanup flow end-to-end.

#### Frontend i18n compliance
- **BIMPage.tsx hardcoded English strings replaced** with i18n
  keys (deferred from the v1.4.4 frontend audit).  ``UploadPanel``,
  ``NonReadyOverlay``, and the empty-state branch now go through
  ``useTranslation()`` — the HARD rule from CLAUDE.md
  (*"ALL user-visible strings go through i18next. No exceptions."*)
  is honoured across the BIM module.  New ``bim.upload_*`` and
  ``bim.overlay_*`` keys added to ``i18n-fallbacks.ts``.

### Verification
- 113 new unit tests passing across 7 vector adapter files
- 20 new unit tests passing for the BIM property matcher
- 3 integration tests passing for the requirements↔BIM cross-module
  flow including the new orphan-cleanup regression test
- Backend ``ruff check`` clean across every file touched in v1.4.5
- Frontend ``tsc --noEmit`` clean
- ``scripts/check_version_sync.py`` passes at 1.4.5
- 21 routes mounted under ``/api/v1/requirements/`` (up from 19)

### Deferred to v1.4.6
- ``project_intelligence.collector`` blind to requirements / bim_hub /
  tasks / assemblies — score is currently a partial picture
- ``project_intelligence/actions.py`` 3 of 8 actions are dead code
  (run_validation / match_cwicr_prices / generate_schedule fall
  back to redirect lying about execution)
- Assembly ``total_rate`` invalidation when CostItem.rate changes
- ``create_vector_routes()`` factory + reduce ~250 LOC of duplicated
  ``vector/status`` and ``vector/reindex`` endpoints
- Trailing-slash audit of 12 broken integration tests
- requirements.list_by_bim_element PostgreSQL JSONB fast path

## [1.4.4] — 2026-04-11

### Fixed — backend hardening cut

A focused stability + correctness pass driven by a multi-agent quality
audit of the v1.4.x backend.  No new user-visible features; the goal
is "everything that already exists works at scale and stays honest
about what version it is".

#### Memory hazard in vector auto-backfill
- ``backend/app/main.py::_auto_backfill_vector_collections`` used to
  ``SELECT *`` from each indexed table on startup, materialise the
  full result set into a Python list, and only THEN slice it down to
  ``vector_backfill_max_rows``.  On a 2M-row production deployment
  that allocated **gigabytes** of RAM at startup before the cap could
  even kick in.
- The new implementation issues a cheap ``SELECT COUNT(*)`` first to
  decide whether reindexing is needed, then pulls only the capped
  number of rows with ``LIMIT`` applied at the SQL level.  Memory
  usage is now bounded by ``vector_backfill_max_rows`` regardless of
  table size.
- Side benefit: the per-collection ``_load_X`` closures collapsed
  into a single declarative ``backfill_targets`` registry — 8 modules
  × ~12 LOC of copy-pasted loaders → one tuple per collection.  Total
  reduction in main.py: ~80 LOC.  This is also the foundation
  v1.4.5's full ``create_vector_routes()`` factory will build on.

#### Deprecated ``datetime.utcnow()`` removed (Python 3.14 readiness)
- ``datetime.utcnow()`` was deprecated in Python 3.12 and becomes a
  hard error in 3.14.  Replaced with ``datetime.now(UTC)`` across
  **8 call sites**: ``boq/router.py:2991``, ``documents/service.py:475``,
  ``tendering/router.py:378``, ``project_intelligence/collector.py:680``,
  ``punchlist/router.py:299``, ``meetings/router.py:984``,
  ``takeoff/router.py:1872``, plus ``bim_hub/router.py:869`` (which
  also got rewritten as part of the next bullet).
- The original quality audit only flagged 4 of these 8 sites; a
  follow-up grep across the whole backend caught the remaining 4.

#### Raw SQL → ORM in BIM upload cross-link
- ``bim_hub/router.py::upload_cad`` was using a hand-rolled
  ``INSERT INTO oe_documents_document`` via ``text()`` to create the
  Documents-hub cross-link entry.  The parameter binding was safe in
  practice but the pattern was fragile (any future schema change to
  ``Document`` would silently break the cross-link without test
  coverage), and it shipped a stray ``datetime.utcnow()``.
- Replaced with a clean ``Document(...)`` ORM insert that picks up
  every default + timestamp from the model and the ``Base`` mixin.
  The cross-link stays a best-effort try/except — it's convenience
  glue, not load-bearing on the main upload flow.

#### Functional ruff cleanup
- ``F401`` unused imports removed from ``boq/events.py``,
  ``project_intelligence/collector.py`` (``uuid``),
  ``project_intelligence/scorer.py`` (``Callable``),
  ``search/router.py`` (``Depends``).
- ``F541`` f-string without placeholders fixed in
  ``project_intelligence/advisor.py:399``.
- ``B905`` ``zip()`` without ``strict=`` fixed in
  ``costs/router.py:1742``.  This is the cost-database resource
  loader — without ``strict=True`` an array length drift would
  silently truncate component rows mid-import and corrupt the
  assembly composition with no audit trail.  ``strict=True`` raises
  immediately so the error is visible.
- Ruff style issues (``UP037``, ``UP041``, ``I001``) auto-fixed in
  ``costs/router.py``, ``project_intelligence/router.py`` /
  ``schemas.py``, ``documents/service.py``.

#### Version-sync CI guard (NEW)
- ``backend/pyproject.toml`` silently drifted from ``frontend/package.json``
  for **four minor versions** (v1.3.32 → v1.4.2 all shipped with
  the Python package stuck on ``1.3.31``, so ``/api/health`` lied
  about which version users were actually getting because
  ``Settings.app_version`` reads from ``importlib.metadata``).  v1.4.3
  retro-fixed the literal but left the door open for the same gap.
- New ``scripts/check_version_sync.py`` reads both files plus the top
  entries of ``CHANGELOG.md`` and ``frontend/src/features/about/Changelog.tsx``,
  and exits non-zero on any mismatch.  Wired into:
  - ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` as a local hook on the four version
    files (so a bump that touches only one file is rejected
    before it can be committed)
  - ``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` as a dedicated ``version-sync`` job
    that runs in parallel with backend + frontend lanes
- Tested negatively (script catches drift) and positively (passes
  with all four files at ``1.4.4``).

### Verification
- Backend ``ruff check`` clean across every file touched in v1.4.4
- Backend ``python -m uvicorn app.main:create_app --factory`` boots
  cleanly via ``app.router.lifespan_context`` smoke test:
  57 modules loaded, 217k vectors indexed, no startup errors
- ``scripts/check_version_sync.py`` passes at ``1.4.4`` after the
  bump (negative test confirmed it would fail at ``1.4.99``)

### Deferred to v1.4.5
- BIMPage.tsx i18n compliance (11+ hardcoded English strings flagged
  by frontend audit; needs sub-component ``useTranslation()``)
- ``create_vector_routes()`` factory + reduce ~250 LOC of duplicated
  ``vector/status`` and ``vector/reindex`` endpoints across 8 modules
- Trailing-slash audit of ``test_cross_module_flows.py`` and
  ``test_api_smoke.py`` (12 failing tests, all caused by missing
  trailing slashes — ``redirect_slashes=False`` is intentional,
  fixes a CORS 307 issue with the frontend)
- Deep-dive audit of recently-added modules (``requirements``,
  ``erp_chat``, ``project_intelligence``, ``bim_hub`` element groups,
  cross-module linking infrastructure) — looking for hacks,
  half-baked logic, missing cross-module wiring

## [1.4.3] — 2026-04-11

### Added — Requirements ↔ BIM cross-module integration

The Requirements module is now the **5th cross-module link type** on
BIM elements, mirroring the existing BOQ / Documents / Tasks /
Schedule activities pattern.  Requirements (EAC triplets — Entity,
Attribute, Constraint) are the bridge between client intent and the
executed model — pinning them to BIM elements lets estimators trace
*"this wall has fire-rating F90 because requirement REQ-042 says so"*
in one click.

#### Backend
- **New `oe_requirements` vector collection** (8th total).  Embeds the
  EAC triplet plus unit / category / priority / status / notes via
  the new ``RequirementVectorAdapter`` in
  ``backend/app/modules/requirements/vector_adapter.py``.  Multilingual
  by default — works across English / German / Russian / Lithuanian /
  French / Spanish / Italian / Polish / Portuguese.
- **Requirements service event publishing** — new ``_safe_publish``
  helper, plus standardised ``requirements.requirement.created /
  updated / deleted / linked_bim`` events on every CRUD and link
  operation.
- **`link_to_bim_elements()` service method** — additive by default
  (merges new ids with the existing array), pass ``replace=true`` to
  overwrite.  Stored under ``Requirement.metadata_["bim_element_ids"]``
  so no schema migration is needed.
- **`list_by_bim_element()` reverse query** — every requirement that
  pins a given BIM element id, scoped to a project for performance.
- **New router endpoints** in ``requirements/router.py``:
  - ``PATCH /requirements/{set_id}/requirements/{req_id}/bim-links/``
  - ``GET  /requirements/by-bim-element/?bim_element_id=&project_id=``
  - ``GET  /requirements/vector/status/``
  - ``POST /requirements/vector/reindex/``
  - ``GET  /requirements/{set_id}/requirements/{req_id}/similar/``
- **`RequirementBrief` schema** in ``bim_hub/schemas.py`` — mirrors
  the relevant subset of ``RequirementResponse`` to avoid a circular
  import.  Added to ``BIMElementResponse.linked_requirements``.
- **`BIMHubService.list_elements_with_links()` Step 6.5** — loads
  every requirement in the project once and filters in Python on the
  ``metadata_["bim_element_ids"]`` array, same cross-dialect pattern
  as the task and activity loops.  Return tuple now has 8 entries.

#### Frontend
- **New `BIMRequirementBrief` interface** + ``linked_requirements``
  field on ``BIMElementData``.
- **New `LinkRequirementToBIMModal`** — mirrors ``LinkActivityToBIMModal``
  exactly: loads every requirement set in the project, flattens
  requirements into a searchable list, click → PATCH the bim-links
  → invalidate the bim-elements query.  Color-coded by priority
  (must / should / may) and status (verified / conflict / open).
- **"Linked requirements" section in BIMViewer details panel** —
  violet themed, slots between "Schedule activities" and the
  semantic similarity panel.  Renders entity.attribute + constraint
  + priority badge + click-to-open.
- **BIMPage wiring** — new ``linkRequirementFor`` state +
  ``handleLinkRequirement`` / ``handleOpenRequirement`` handlers,
  modal mount, props passed to ``<BIMViewer>``.
- **RequirementsPage badge** — the expanded row now shows a
  "Pinned BIM elements" cell with the count read from
  ``metadata.bim_element_ids``.  Click navigates to ``/bim?element=...``
  with the first pinned element preselected.
- **RequirementsPage deep link** — parses ``?id=<requirement_id>``,
  fans out detail fetches across every set in the project to find
  the owning set, switches to it and expands the row.  Strips the
  param after one shot so refresh doesn't reapply.
- **GlobalSearchModal facet support** — fuchsia color for the new
  Requirements pill, ``oe_requirements`` mapped to ``/requirements?id=``
  in ``hitToHref``.
- **VectorStatusCard** picks up the new ``oe_requirements`` collection
  via the existing ``REINDEX_PATH`` table — admins can trigger a
  reindex from Settings.
- **Auto-backfill on startup** now indexes the requirements collection
  alongside the other 7 (capped by ``vector_backfill_max_rows``).

### Fixed (polish bundled into this cut)
- ``backend/pyproject.toml`` had silently drifted from the frontend
  version since v1.3.31 — every bump from v1.3.32 → v1.4.2 updated
  ``frontend/package.json`` but not the Python package.  ``/api/health``
  has therefore been reporting ``version: "1.3.31"`` across the entire
  v1.4.x series because ``app.config.Settings.app_version`` reads from
  ``importlib.metadata.version("openconstructionerp")``.  Bumped
  directly to ``1.4.3`` so the next deploy reports the real version.
- ``bim_hub/router.py`` CAD upload handler referenced ``cad_path`` and
  ``cad_dir`` variables that were never defined after the storage
  abstraction was introduced — the IFC/RVT processing branch crashed
  with ``NameError`` on every upload attempt (``ruff`` flagged the
  same issue as ``F821``).  Replaced the ghost variables with a
  ``tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`` workspace: the upload is materialised
  locally for the sync processor, any generated geometry is uploaded
  back through ``bim_file_storage.save_geometry`` before the tempdir
  is cleaned up, and the Documents hub cross-link now stores the real
  storage key returned by ``save_original_cad`` instead of the phantom
  ``cad_path``.
- ``SimilarItemsPanel`` no longer claims to support requirements —
  the generic panel only knows the item id, but the requirement
  similar endpoint is nested under the parent set
  (``/requirements/{set_id}/requirements/{req_id}/similar/``), so
  it needs both.  Requirement similarity is reachable only from the
  set-scoped detail page; the generic cross-module panel would have
  returned 404 for every call.  Removed the placeholder URL and the
  ``'requirements'`` entry from ``SimilarModuleKind``.

### Verification
- 718 total routes mounted across 57 loaded modules (real count from
  ``module_loader.load_all`` + ``fastapi.routing.APIRoute`` inspection)
- 8 vector collections, all with real adapters and reindex endpoints
- Frontend ``tsc --noEmit`` clean
- Backend ``ruff check`` clean across every file touched in v1.4.3
- New tests: unit coverage for ``RequirementVectorAdapter``
  (``to_text`` / ``to_payload`` / ``project_id_of``) plus an integration
  test that drives ``PATCH /bim-links/`` → ``GET /by-bim-element/``
  → ``GET /models/{id}/elements/`` (Step 6.5) end-to-end

## [1.4.2] — 2026-04-11

### Security
- **SQL injection guard in LanceDB id-quoting** — every row id passed
  to ``_lancedb_index_generic``, ``_lancedb_delete_generic`` and the
  legacy ``_lancedb_index`` cost-collection upsert is now re-parsed as
  a strict ``uuid.UUID`` before being interpolated into the
  ``id IN (...)`` filter via the new ``_safe_quote_ids`` helper.
  Defence-in-depth — the adapter layer always passes UUIDs from
  SQLAlchemy ``GUID()`` columns, so a parse failure now indicates a
  bug or attack and the row is silently dropped.
- **Qdrant search payload mutation** — ``vector_search_collection``
  was using ``payload.pop()`` to extract reserved fields, which
  mutated the qdrant client's cached result objects.  Replaced with
  ``get()`` + a non-mutating dict comprehension.

### Fixed
- **Token-aware text clipping** — ``_safe_text`` now uses the active
  SentenceTransformer's tokenizer (when available) to clip at 510
  tokens instead of the previous 4000-character cap.  4000 chars
  routinely exceeded the 512-token cap of small SBERT models, causing
  silent in-model truncation that lost meaningful tail content.
  Falls back to the character cap when the tokenizer isn't available.
- **Frontend deep links now actually work** — `hitToHref` was
  generating route formats that no destination page parsed:
  - BOQ now uses ``/boq/<boqId>?highlight=<positionId>`` matching the
    real ``BOQEditorPage`` route + query.
  - DocumentsPage parses ``?id=<docId>`` and auto-opens the preview.
  - TasksPage parses ``?id=<taskId>``, scrolls the matching card into
    view, and adds a 2.5s ring highlight.
  - RiskRegisterPage parses ``?id=<riskId>`` and opens detail view.
  - BIMPage parses ``?element=<elementId>`` and selects the element
    once the elements list resolves.
  - Chat hits navigate to ``?session=<sessionId>`` from the new chat
    payload field.
  Each deep-link parser strips the query param after one shot so a
  refresh doesn't keep re-applying it.

### Added — BIM cross-module gap closure
- **`GET /api/v1/bim_hub/coverage-summary/?project_id=...`** — new
  aggregation endpoint returning ``{elements_total,
  elements_linked_to_boq, elements_costed, elements_validated,
  elements_with_documents, elements_with_tasks,
  elements_with_activities}`` plus matching percentages.  Each count is
  a single SELECT in the same async session — no N+1.  Documents,
  tasks, activities and validation are fetched defensively so a
  missing optional module doesn't 500 the call.
- **Dashboard `BIMCoverageCard`** — new widget rendering 6 progress
  bars + a headline percentage (avg of all 6 metrics).  Hides itself
  entirely on projects with zero BIM elements so non-BIM workflows
  stay clean.  Color-coded by completeness (green ≥75% / amber ≥40% /
  rose otherwise).
- **BOQ position BIM badge is now clickable** — the `OrdinalCellRenderer`
  blue pill that shows the linked BIM element count is no longer a
  read-only `<span>`; it's a `<button>` that navigates to
  ``/bim?element=<first_id>``.  Estimators can finally jump from a
  BOQ row to the 3D model element it was created from in one click.
- **Schedule activity BIM badge** — Gantt activity rows now render a
  small amber pill with the count of pinned BIM elements when
  ``activity.bim_element_ids`` is non-empty.  Click navigates to the
  BIM viewer with the first pinned element preselected.  Closes the
  4D-schedule reverse-nav gap.
- **BIM Quantity Rules page — Suggest from CWICR** — when a rule's
  target is "auto-create", the editor now exposes a "Default unit
  rate" field plus a one-click "Suggest from CWICR" button that calls
  ``/api/v1/costs/suggest-for-element/`` with the rule's filter
  context (element_type_filter, name, property_filter material) and
  prefills the top match.  The rate persists into
  ``boq_target.unit_rate`` and is read by the apply path
  (``_auto_create_position_for_rule``) so the new BOQ position lands
  fully priced — no second pass in the BOQ editor.

### Verification
- 766 total routes mounted (up from 765 in v1.4.1).  New routes:
  ``/api/v1/bim_hub/coverage-summary/``.
- Frontend ``tsc --noEmit`` clean.
- Backend ``ruff check`` clean across every file touched in v1.4.2
  (4 pre-existing warnings in unrelated bim_hub/router.py CAD upload
  and BOQ-access-verifier code paths are not from this sweep).
- ``_safe_quote_ids`` smoke-tested against literal SQL injection
  payloads and confirms attacker strings are dropped.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Validation reports vector adapter** — `oe_validation` collection now
  has a real adapter (`backend/app/modules/validation/vector_adapter.py`),
  event subscribers wired to the new `validation.report.created/deleted`
  publishes, and `/api/v1/validation/vector/status/`,
  `/vector/reindex/`, `/{id}/similar/` endpoints.  Semantic search across
  validation history (e.g. "find reports about missing classification
  codes") now works.
- **Chat messages vector adapter** — `oe_chat` collection now has a real
  adapter (`backend/app/modules/erp_chat/vector_adapter.py`).  User and
  assistant messages with non-empty content are auto-indexed via the new
  `erp_chat.message.created` event publish in
  `service.py:_persist_messages`.  Long-term semantic memory for the
  AI advisor and per-message similarity search both now functional.
- **Auto-backfill on startup** — new `_auto_backfill_vector_collections`
  helper in `backend/app/main.py` runs as a detached background task
  during the lifespan startup.  For each of the 7 collections it
  compares the live row count to the indexed count and backfills any
  missing rows (capped by `vector_backfill_max_rows=5000` per pass to
  protect against multi-million-row tenants).  Disable with
  `vector_auto_backfill=False` in settings.  This closes the upgrade
  gap where existing v1.3.x BOQ / Document / Task / Risk / BIM / chat
  rows were unsearchable until the user manually called every per-module
  reindex endpoint.
- **Settings → Semantic Search Status panel** — new `VectorStatusCard`
  in `frontend/src/features/settings/`.  Renders a per-collection
  health table fetched from `/api/v1/search/status/` with one-click
  reindex buttons (POST to the matching `/vector/reindex/` route),
  engine + model + dimension + total-vectors badges, connection
  indicator and a "purge first" toggle for embedding-model migrations.

### Fixed
- The `bim_hub.element.updated` event subscription is now documented
  as a forward-compat hook (no current publisher — BIM elements are
  refreshed via the bulk-import path which already publishes
  `created`).  The day a `PATCH /elements/{id}/` endpoint lands, vector
  freshness will work without any wiring change.
- Backend `ruff check` clean across every file touched in this sweep
  (auto-fixed I001 import-order issues in two files).

### Verification
- Full app boot: 765 routes, 34 vector / similar / search routes (up
  from 28 in v1.4.0).  All 7 collections now have real adapters.
- `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small` model loads from HuggingFace cache
  on first encode call — confirmed by Python boot.
- Frontend `tsc --noEmit` clean.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Cross-module semantic memory layer** — every business module now
  participates in a unified vector store via the new
  `app/core/vector_index.py` `EmbeddingAdapter` protocol.  Six new
  collections live alongside the existing CWICR cost index:
  `oe_boq_positions`, `oe_documents`, `oe_tasks`, `oe_risks`,
  `oe_bim_elements`, `oe_validation`, `oe_chat`.  All collections share
  the same schema (id / vector / text / tenant_id / project_id / module
  / payload) so the unified search layer can write to any of them
  through one code path.
- **Multilingual embedding model** — switched the default from
  `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (English-mostly) to `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small`
  (50+ languages, same 384-dim).  CWICR's 9-language cost database now
  ranks correctly across English, German, Russian, Lithuanian, French,
  Spanish, Italian, Polish and Portuguese.  The legacy model is kept as
  a graceful fallback so existing LanceDB tables stay loadable.
- **Event-driven indexing** — every Position / Document / Task / Risk /
  BIM Element create/update/delete event now triggers an automatic
  upsert into the matching vector collection.  No cron jobs, no Celery
  workers, no manual reindex needed for normal operation.  Failures are
  logged and swallowed so vector indexing can never break a CRUD path.
- **Per-module reindex / status / similar endpoints** — every
  participating module now exposes:
  - `GET  /vector/status/` — collection health + row count
  - `POST /vector/reindex/?project_id=...&purge_first=false` — backfill
  - `GET  /{id}/similar/?limit=5&cross_project=true` — top-N most
    semantically similar rows, optionally cross-project
  Live: `/api/v1/boq/`, `/api/v1/documents/`, `/api/v1/tasks/`,
  `/api/v1/risk/`, `/api/v1/bim_hub/elements/`.
- **Unified cross-collection search API** — new `oe_search` module:
  - `GET /api/v1/search/?q=...&types=boq,documents,risks&project_id=...`
    fans out to every selected collection in parallel and merges the
    results via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (Cormack et al., 2009).
  - `GET /api/v1/search/status/` — aggregated per-collection health
  - `GET /api/v1/search/types/` — list of supported short names
- **Cmd+Shift+K Global Search modal** — frontend `GlobalSearchModal`
  with debounced input, facet pills (BOQ / Documents / Tasks / Risks /
  BIM / Validation / Chat) showing per-collection hit counts, current
  project scope toggle, grouped results and click-to-navigate routing.
  Works from any page including text fields so estimators can trigger
  semantic search while editing a BOQ row.
- **`<SimilarItemsPanel>` shared component** — universal "more like this"
  card that drops next to any record with `module="risks" id={...}`.
  Embedded in:
  - Risk Register detail view (cross-project lessons learned reuse)
  - BIM viewer element details panel
  - Documents preview modal (cross-project related drawings)
- **AI Chat semantic tools** — six new tool definitions for the ERP Chat
  agent: `search_boq_positions`, `search_documents`, `search_tasks`,
  `search_risks`, `search_bim_elements`, `search_anything`.  Each tool
  returns ranked hits with score + match reasons and the chat panel
  renders them as compact result cards.  System prompt updated to
  prefer semantic tools for free-text questions.
- **AI Advisor RAG injection** — `project_intelligence/advisor.py`
  `answer_question()` now retrieves the top-12 semantic hits from the
  unified search layer and injects them into the LLM prompt as a
  "Relevant context (semantic retrieval)" block.  The advisor is now a
  proper RAG agent — answers stay anchored in real evidence instead of
  hallucinating from the structured project state alone.

### Architecture
- New foundation file `backend/app/core/vector_index.py` — protocol,
  hit dataclass, RRF fusion, search/find_similar/index_one helpers.
- Multi-collection helpers in `backend/app/core/vector.py` —
  `vector_index_collection`, `vector_search_collection`,
  `vector_delete_collection`, `vector_count_collection` plus the
  `_lancedb_*_generic` and Qdrant equivalents.
- New `backend/app/modules/search/` module with manifest, schemas,
  service and router.
- Per-module `vector_adapter.py` files in `boq`, `documents`, `tasks`,
  `risk`, `bim_hub` — tiny stateless adapters implementing the
  `EmbeddingAdapter` protocol.

### Verification
- 759 total routes mounted; 28 vector / similar / search routes wired
  end-to-end.
- 217 487 CWICR cost vectors auto-loaded from existing LanceDB index on
  startup.
- Frontend `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- Backend imports clean across foundation + 5 modules + unified search
  + 6 new chat tools + advisor RAG.
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion smoke-tested on synthetic rankings.

## [1.3.32] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- **BIM viewer health stats banner** — top-of-viewport multi-pill banner
  shows total elements, BOQ-linked count, validation errors, warnings,
  has-tasks and has-documents counts.  Each pill is clickable and applies
  the matching smart filter to the viewport in one click.
- **Smart filter chips in BIMFilterPanel** — same five health buckets
  exposed as chips at the top of the filter sidebar (errors, warnings,
  unlinked-to-BOQ, has tasks, has documents).  Counts are computed from
  the cross-module link arrays on each element.
- **Color-by status modes** in the BIM viewer — three new colour-by
  options grouped under "By compliance":  🛡️ Validation status (red /
  amber / green), 💰 BOQ link coverage (red unlinked / green linked),
  📄 Document coverage.  Implemented via a new
  `ElementManager.colorByDirect()` helper that paints meshes from a
  fixed palette without rebuilding materials.
- **Cost auto-suggestion for BIM elements** — new
  `POST /api/v1/costs/suggest-for-element/` endpoint ranks CWICR cost
  items by classification overlap, element-type / material / family
  keyword matches and discipline tag overlap.  Each result carries a
  0..1 confidence score and human-readable match reasons.
- **Cost suggestion chips in AddToBOQModal** — the "Create new position"
  tab now fetches the top-5 ranked rates for the clicked element and
  renders them as one-click chips with code, description, unit rate and
  confidence dot.  Clicking a chip populates description / unit /
  unit_rate from the matching cost item — no manual lookup needed.

## [1.3.31] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Inline create-from-element modals** in BIM viewer — three new
  modals (`CreateTaskFromBIMModal`, `LinkDocumentToBIMModal`,
  `LinkActivityToBIMModal`) let the user create new tasks, link existing
  documents, and link existing schedule activities to a BIM element
  WITHOUT leaving the viewer.
- **Validation ↔ BIM per-element rules engine** — new
  `POST /api/v1/validation/check-bim-model` endpoint runs universal
  BIM rules (wall has thickness, structural has material, fire-rating
  present, MEP has system, etc.) against every element in a model.
  Per-element results eager-loaded into `BIMElementResponse.validation_results`
  + worst-severity rollup in `validation_status`.
- **Per-element validation badge** in the BIM viewer details panel,
  colour-coded by worst severity.
- **Tasks page** — `TaskCard` now renders a "Pinned to N BIM element(s)"
  badge with click-to-jump navigation.

### Fixed
- `ValidationReportResponse` pydantic schema collision with SQLAlchemy
  `MetaData()` class-level registry — switched to `validation_alias`.

## [1.3.30] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **BIM viewer cross-module deep integration** — element details panel now
  shows four collapsible link sections in one place: Linked BOQ Positions
  (existing), Linked Documents (drawings/RFIs/photos), Linked Tasks
  (defects/issues), Schedule Activities (4D timeline). Each section has
  count badges, clicking any row navigates to the target detail page.
- **Documents ↔ BIM** — new `oe_documents_bim_link` table + GET/POST/DELETE
  endpoints under `/api/v1/documents/bim-links/`. Bidirectional querying.
  Eager-loaded into `BIMElementResponse.linked_documents`.
- **Tasks ↔ BIM** — new `Task.bim_element_ids` JSON column. PATCH
  `/api/v1/tasks/{id}/bim-links` + reverse query. Eager-loaded into
  `BIMElementResponse.linked_tasks`.
- **Schedule ↔ BIM** — wired up the dormant `Activity.bim_element_ids` field
  with PATCH endpoint and `/api/v1/schedule/activities/by-bim-element/`
  reverse query. Eager-loaded into `BIMElementResponse.linked_activities`.
- **Documents preview modal** — new "Linked BIM elements" footer strip with
  click-to-navigate chips.

## [1.3.29] — 2026-04-11

### Changed
- **Chat page** — removed the redundant "ERP AI Assistant" top bar. The
  app's main layout already provides a header; the chat-specific bar
  duplicated UI and didn't match the rest of the site palette. Clear
  chat now lives in the input bar.
- **Release process** — CHANGELOG.md now mirrors the in-app
  `Changelog.tsx` so the GitHub release workflow can extract the right
  section when a tag is pushed (the workflow at `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  reads `## [VERSION]` patterns from this file).

## [1.3.28] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Universal Building / Other split** in BIM filter — every category
  is classified by its semantic bucket and rendered in either a
  "real building elements" section (chips at top) or a collapsible
  "Annotations & analytical" section (closed by default). Works
  zero-curation for any project.
- **Pretty category names** for ~150 well-known Revit categories
  ("Curtainwallmullions" → "Curtain Wall Mullions", "Doortags" → "Door Tags").
  Anything not in the table passes through with first-letter
  capitalised — no wrong algorithmic word splits.

### Fixed
- BIM filter "None" element_type (the 6 048 Revit-ingest junk rows in
  the demo) now classified as noise.
- Headless test verdict baseline comparison.

## [1.3.27] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **3 grouping modes** in BIM filter via segmented control:
  **By Category** (flat, default), **By Type Name** (Revit Browser
  hierarchy), **Buckets** (semantic).

## [1.3.26] — 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **"Add to BOQ" 500** — the v1.3.22 backend agent's ownership check
  referenced `position.project_id` but Position has no such column;
  the project lives on the parent BOQ via `position.boq_id`. Fix:
  rewrote `_verify_boq_position_access` as a single-row SELECT joining
  Position → BOQ.

## [1.3.25] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Saved Groups panel section** in BIMFilterPanel — collapsible,
  one-click apply, hover-revealed link/delete actions.
- Headless test full saved-group lifecycle (save → list → apply → delete).

## [1.3.24] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Pluggable storage backend** (`app/core/storage.py`) with
  `LocalStorageBackend` (default) and `S3StorageBackend` (opt-in via
  `pip install openconstructionerp[s3]`). Supports MinIO / AWS / Backblaze /
  DigitalOcean Spaces.
- **BIM Element Groups** — new `oe_bim_element_group` table for saved
  selections. Dynamic groups recompute members from a filter; static
  groups freeze the snapshot.
- **SaveGroupModal** for saving the current filter as a named group.
- **Architecture doc** — `docs/BIM-STORAGE-ARCHITECTURE.md` with the
  three-layer design + migration path.

## [1.3.23] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- Headless deep test (`frontend/debug-bim.cjs`) extended with 4 new
  test groups verifying every UI surface from v1.3.22.
- `ElementManager.batchMeshesByMaterial()` — three.js BatchedMesh
  collapse for big-model perf (gated at 50 000+ meshes pending GPU
  visibility-sync work).

### Fixed
- Sidebar `nav.bim_rules` translation key.

## [1.3.22] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **BIM ↔ BOQ linking** end-to-end. Backend embeds `boq_links` in
  element response; `apply_quantity_maps` actually persists; `Position.cad_element_ids`
  auto-syncs on link CRUD.
- **Add to BOQ modal** — Link to existing position OR create new with
  pre-filled quantities, single-element and bulk modes.
- **Quick takeoff** button in filter panel — bulk-link visible elements.
- **BIM Quantity Rules page** at `/bim/rules` — dedicated UI for rule-based
  bulk linking.
- **Selection sync store** — BOQ row click highlights linked BIM
  elements orange and vice versa.
- **Toolbar rework** — removed broken 4D/5D stubs, added camera
  presets (Fit / Iso / Top / Front / Side), grid toggle.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-09

### Added

- **UserSearchInput** component — searchable dropdown for selecting team members across all modules
- **Document Hub cross-linking** — photos and BIM files automatically appear in Documents module with source tags (`photo`, `bim`, `site`, `ifc`, etc.)
- **CDE Link Document modal** — searchable document picker instead of redirect to /documents page
- **20-language translations** for User Management module

### Fixed
- **All form field mismatches** — systematic audit and fix of 15+ modules (Tasks, Meetings, RFI, NCR, Submittals, Inspections, Correspondence, Contacts, Transmittals, Finance, Safety, Procurement)
- **Trailing slash CORS issue** — all GET list endpoints now use trailing slash to prevent 307 redirect → CORS block
- **Contacts display** — field names aligned with backend (`first_name`/`last_name`, `primary_email`, `country_code`)
- **Procurement PO list** — fixed endpoint URL (`/purchase-orders` → `/`) and paginated response handling
- **Transmittals list** — fixed paginated response handling

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added — Professional BOQ features
- **Custom Columns** with 7 one-click presets — Procurement (Supplier, Lead Time, PO Number, PO Status), Notes, Quality Control (QC Status, Inspector, Date), Sustainability (CO₂, EPD, Material Source), **German Tender Style** (KG-Bezug, Lohn-EP, Material-EP, Geräte-EP, Sonstiges-EP, Wagnis %), **Austrian Tender Style** (LV-Position, Stichwort, Lohn-Anteil %, Aufschlag %, Lieferant), **BIM Integration** (IFC GUID, Element ID, Storey, Phase). Manual form for everything else. Live fill-rate progress bar shows how complete each column is.
- **Renumber positions** with gap-of-10 scheme (`01`, `01.10`, `01.20`, `02`, `02.10`) — matches the professional German/Austrian tender output convention. Lets you insert `01.15` later without renumbering everything else. New `POST /boqs/{id}/renumber` endpoint + toolbar button.
- **Excel round-trip with custom columns** — supplier, notes and procurement values are now exported to .xlsx and survive a full import → edit → export cycle. Number-typed columns are formatted as numbers in the spreadsheet.
- **Project Health bar** on Project Detail — circular progress with 5 checkpoints (BOQ created → positions added → all priced → validation run → no errors) and a single "Next step" button that always points at the first incomplete item.

### Added — Security hardening (from QA / pentest report)
- **Strong password policy** — 8+ chars, ≥1 letter, ≥1 digit, blacklist of 24 common/leaked passwords. `password`, `12345678` and friends are now rejected with a clear 422.
- **Login rate limit** — 10 attempts per minute per IP, returns 429 with `Retry-After` header.
- **JWT freshness check** — old tokens are invalidated automatically when the user changes password (via `password_changed_at` column + `iat` comparison in `get_current_user_payload`).
- **Security headers middleware** — `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, `Content-Security-Policy` (relaxed for SPA, excluded from /docs and /redoc), `Strict-Transport-Security` (HTTPS only).
- **Schedule date validation** — `start_date > end_date` is now rejected with a clear 422 (Pydantic `model_validator`).
- **PDF upload magic-byte check** — `/takeoff/documents/upload` now rejects JPGs/HTML/etc. renamed to `.pdf`.
- **Cross-user permission boundary verified** — User B gets 403 on every attempt to read/modify/delete User A's data (end-to-end test in place).

### Added — UX & frontend
- **User-friendly API error messages** — `ApiError` now extracts the actual FastAPI `detail` string instead of `"API 500: Internal Server Error"`. Covers FastAPI 422 validation arrays, generic envelopes, and per-status fallbacks (400/401/403/404/409/413/422/429/500/502/503/504). Network errors and `AbortError` get their own friendly text. 14 i18n keys × 21 locales added.
- **Modernized update notification** in the sidebar — gradient emerald/teal/cyan card with pulsing Sparkles icon, grouped highlights (New / Fixed / Polished), in-app changelog link (scrolls to `/about#changelog`), GitHub release link, change-count badge. Caches the GitHub response in `localStorage` (1h TTL) so multi-tab sessions don't burn the unauthenticated rate limit.
- **Continue your work** card on Dashboard — gradient card showing the most recently updated BOQ with name, project, position count and grand total; one click jumps back to the editor.
- **Role-aware ChangeOrders Approve button** — hidden for non-admin/manager roles; an "Awaiting approval" amber badge appears instead, so users no longer click into a 403.
- **Highlight unpriced positions** in the BOQ grid — subtle amber background and 3px left border on rows where `qty > 0` but `unit_rate = 0`.
- **Duplicate-name guard** for new projects — typing a name that matches an existing project shows an amber warning and requires a second click to confirm.
- **Single source-of-truth** for app version — `package.json` is the only place to edit. Sidebar, About page, error logger, update checker and bug-report params all import `APP_VERSION` from a Vite-injected define.
- **Changelog** entries filled in for v0.5.0, v0.6.0, v0.7.0 (previously the in-app history jumped from v0.4 → v0.7 with no notes).
- **Accessibility** — `<h1>` (sr-only) on /login and /register, `name` and `id` attributes on all auth inputs, `aria-label` on password show/hide buttons, dead `_SavedSessionsList` removed.
- **Keyboard shortcuts dialog** — removed misleading shortcuts that browsers reserved (`Ctrl+N`, `Ctrl+Shift+N`); fixed buggy "Ctrl then Shift then V" separator; added `g r` → Reports and `g t` → Tendering navigation sequences.

### Fixed — backend critical bugs
- **`ChangeOrders POST /items` returned 500 for every payload** — `MissingGreenlet` on `order.code` after `_recalculate_cost_impact` (which calls `expire_all`) triggered a lazy load in async context. Fix: capture identifying fields before the recalc, then `refresh(item)` after.
- **`5D /generate-budget` returned 500 on missing `boq_id`** — bare `uuid.UUID(str(...))` raised on empty body. Fix: validate explicitly with try/except → 422 on bad input. Auto-pick the most recently updated BOQ when omitted.
- **Project soft-delete was leaky** — `DELETE /projects/{id}` set `status=archived`, but the project still came back from `GET`, list, and BOQ list. Fix: `get_project` gains `include_archived` flag (default `False`); `list_projects` defaults to `exclude_archived=True`; BOQ verify treats archived as 404.
- **Requirements module tables were missing on fresh installs** — module models were not imported in `main.py`/`alembic env.py`, so `Base.metadata.create_all()` skipped them. Fix: added the missing imports; same for 6 other previously missing module models.
- **Custom Columns SQLAlchemy JSON persistence** — only the FIRST added column was being saved due to in-place dict mutation. Fix: build a fresh `dict` and call `flag_modified(boq, "metadata_")` to defeat value-based change detection.
- **Custom column edit silently rewrote `total`/`unit_rate`** — `update_position` re-derived pricing from `metadata.resources` on every metadata patch. Fix: only re-derive when `quantity` actually changed OR the resources list itself differs from what's stored. Critical correctness fix for resource-priced positions.

### Changed
- The visible "Quick Start Estimate" flow now uses **gap-of-10 ordinals** by default — new positions get `01.40`, `01.50` etc. instead of `01.4`, `01.5`.
- `update_position` is stricter about when it touches pricing fields — only quantity/rate/resource changes recalculate `total`. Pure metadata patches leave the existing total intact.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: pip install -e ./backend** — `[project.urls]` was placed before `dependencies` in pyproject.toml, breaking editable installs and PyPI builds
- **CRITICAL: BOQ Duplication crash** — MissingGreenlet error when duplicating BOQ (eagerly capture ORM attributes before session expiry)
- **CRITICAL: CWICR import 500 error** — ProcessPoolExecutor fails on Windows/uvicorn; replaced with asyncio.to_thread
- **Security: Path traversal** — Document/takeoff download endpoints now resolve symlinks and sandbox-check paths
- **Security: CORS** — Block wildcard `*` origins in production mode with warning
- **Security: Login enumeration** — Deactivated accounts return same 401 as invalid credentials; password policy not revealed before auth
- **Security: Catalog price factor** — Bounded to `0 < factor ≤ 10` with explicit validation
- **Docker quickstart** — Dockerfile copies full backend (incl. README.md for hatchling), installs `[server]` extras, creates frontend/dist dir, uses development mode
- **Alembic migration** — Replaced broken init migration (DROP non-existent tables) with no-op baseline
- **Nginx** — Added CSP, HSTS, Permissions-Policy security headers
- **35 test errors** — Marked standalone test_full_platform.py with pytest.mark.skip

### Added
- Version number (v0.2.0) displayed in sidebar footer
- "Run Setup Wizard" link in welcome modal for re-onboarding
- Comparison table in README (vs commercial estimating suites)

### Changed
- CLI command renamed from `openestimate` to `openconstructionerp`
- DDC Toolkit → DDC cad2data in all references
- README screenshots use real PNG files (not placeholder JPGs)

### Removed
- 11 development screenshot JPGs from repository root
- Test failure PNG from frontend/test-results/
